### 🤔 What is Computer Science ? 
#### 🧠 Foundational concepts & ideas
> [!INFO] **Computing**
> - **Definition**: *Computing comes from compute which means to determine by calculation, to count, **to calculate**.*
> - **Usage**: *Computing is an activity that allows us to quantify, analyze, and optimize decisions in order to reduce uncertainty in the world, adapt and predict*

> [!INFO] **Computer Science**
> - **Definition**: *Computer science (CS) is **the study of computing**, which includes all phenomena related to computers.*
> - **Usage**: *It focuses on studying and applying algorithms to create applications and solutions that impact all areas of society.*

> [!INFO] **Algorithm**
> - **Definition**: *An algorithm is a **sequence of precise instructions** that enables computing. This includes components computers use to process information. Algorithms use inputs and a finite number of steps to carry out arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and produce outputs used in computing. An algorithm is a sequence of steps/instructions that must be followed in a specific order to solve a problem.*
> - **Usage**: *We use algorithms **to find solutions to problems**.*

> [!INFO] **Computer, Hardware, Software**
> - *A computer is **a machine that performs calculations by automation, allowing less human effort**.*
> - All computers are made of physical material that we refer to as hardware. **Hardware** is the computer component that enables computations. Hardware has four components, including **processor, memory, network, and storage**.
> - The processor follows instructions from algorithms and processes data.
> - The memory addresses and stores data in consistent locations.
> - The network refers to the various technological devices that are connected and share information.
> - Storage permanently stores data.
> - The *algorithmic principles that determine how results are computed* makes up **software**. 


> [!INFO] **Program, Programming Language**
> - A computer  program is an algorithm that can be run on a computer.
> - A programming language consists of symbols and instructions that can be interpreted by a computer.

#### 💡Other Ideas

 >[!TIP] Synthesis
 > - **Theoretical computer science** focuses on the mathematical processes behind software.
> - **Almost all computers**, are considered **Turing-complete** (or Computationally Universal, as opposed to specialized computing devices such as scientific calculators) because **they share the same fundamental model for computing results and every computer has the ability to run any algorithm**.
> - A Turing-complete computer stores data in memory and manipulates that data according to a **computer program**, . These programs are represented using symbols and instructions written in a programming language. Programs are also stored in memory, which allows programmers to modify and improve programs by changing the instructions.
> - Computer science is evolving from its purely mathematical and theoretical roots—which define the logical and efficient limits of computation via Turing-completeness—to a more holistic discipline that integrates specialized hardware, human-centered social values, and the cognitive complexities of fields like Human Computer Interaction and education.

### 🔍  History of Computer Science
> [!TIP] Synthesis
> - The first computing devices appeared early in many human civilizations, they were physical devices such as the **abacus**. They were used **to count, add numbers**.  Around that time, the concept of **algorithm** was invented. 
> - In 1614, John Napier, developed **logarithms** : **a shortcut for making tedious calculations**. This became the foundation for multiple **analog calculating machines** invented during the 1600s. 
> - In the 1820s, Charles Babbage invented the **Difference Engine to prevent human errors in manual calculations** through **automation**. Babbage followed with his invention of the **Analytical Engine**. It was **program-controlled** and included features like an **integrated memory** and an **arithmetic logic unit**. Ada Lovelace used **punched cards** to create **sequencing instructions** that could be read by the Analytical Engine to automatically perform any calculation included in the programming code. With her work on the Analytical Engine, **Lovelace became the world’s first computer programmer**.
> -  By the end of the 1800s and leading into the early 1900s, calculators, adding machines, typewriters, and related machines became more commonplace, setting the stage for the invention of the computer.
> - In the 1940s, multiple computers became available, including **IBM’s Harvard Mark 1**. These were the forerunners to the advent of the **digital computer** in the 1950s. Computers went from mechanical devices to electronic devices using at first light bulbs, then evolved to transistors, silicons, lithium materials. 
> - Computer science emerged as an academic discipline rooted in the principles of mathematics, primarily in elite institutions, and funded by demand from the military. 
> - **As computers could execute programs faster than humans, computer science replaced human-powered calculation with computer-powered problem-solving methods**.

### 💻 The Capabilities and Limitations of Computer Science
 >[!TIP] Synthesis
 >- **Economic Disparity:** Although Black culture drives massive engagement and profit on platforms like TikTok and X, the financial benefits and data ownership typically flow to dominant corporations rather than Black creators or entrepreneurs.
 >- **The Digital Divide:** Systemic barriers—including unequal access to high-speed internet, unreliable electricity, and the high cost of AI subscriptions—prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in the modern computing economy.
 >- **Technopolitical Barriers:** In the Global South, the legacy of imperialism and existing racial hierarchies creates social tensions that make purely technical solutions (like the OLPC project) fail when they ignore local sociopolitical contexts.
 >- **Design Limitations:** Technologies often reproduce social inequities because they are frequently designed by "dominant designers" who lack direct experience with the resource constraints or needs of the underserved populations they aim to serve.
 >- **The "Design Justice" Shift:** True progress requires a transition from "building for" to "building with" marginalized communities, centering the ingenuity of the local user to ensure technology acts as a tool for liberation rather than a reinforcement of the status quo.

### 📑 How computer science interacts with other disciplines 
 >[!TIP] Synthesis
 > - By contributing tools and resources to handle tasks and improve operations, computer science enables many other fields and areas of research or development.
 > - Data science is an interdisciplinary field that applies computing to managing data and extracting information from data. Many millions of people engage in data science work by using spreadsheets. Still, data science also often emphasizes larger-scale problems involving big data that are hard to manage using spreadsheets alone.
 > - Computational science refers to applying computing concepts and technologies to advance scientific research and practical applications of science knowledge. Computer science’s emphasis on creating things can help other sciences by, for example, contributing new models or simulations that can enable the discovery of new kinds of scientific knowledge previously inaccessible to scientists.
 > - Information science is an interdisciplinary field studying information technologies and systems as they relate to people, organizations, and societies. As computing is now so central to information management and information exchange, information science has significant overlap with computer science. Still, it tends to emphasize the social value of information, whereas computer science has (historically) emphasized algorithms and computation over people or information.
 > - Today, computer science is an interdisciplinary field that contributes to all other fields. Effective computational solutions to research or business problems require combining domain-specific knowledge with computer science concepts from a combination of areas.
