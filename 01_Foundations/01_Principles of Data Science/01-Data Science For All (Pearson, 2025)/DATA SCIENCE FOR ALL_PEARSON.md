# 📘 DATA SCIENCE FOR ALL (Davis & Glanz, 2025)

## 📝 Abstract
> This book is a transition manual. It teaches how to take a raw data table (**Input**) and apply a series of logical transformations to reach a strategic decision (**Output**) without being misled by randomness or poor data quality.

## 🏗️ I. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
- **👤 Authors:** Brennan Davis, Hunter Glanz.
- **🌐 Global Topology:** **Linear** 🔗
- **🎯 Target Audience:** Logical beginners / Engineers.
- **⚙️ Global Objective:** To filter out the "noise" (errors, missing data, bias) to keep only the "signal" (the proof) in order to act with certainty.

## 🔗 III. SYSTEMIC CONNECTIONS
- **📊 Data Science Impact:** Methodology to validate any predictive model.
- **🛠️ Action:** Transition from "I think" to "The data proves."
- **🧩 Strategic Fit:** Foundations for the "Personal Master’s." Turning data into a controlled system.

## 👁️ IV. ARCHITECTURAL SYNTHESIS
- **🧠 System Model:** A "refining" process. Raw input -> Impurity removal -> Solid decision.
- **✨ Consistency:** High. Theoretical logic validated by "Tech Center" practice and "Ethics" guardrails.
