## 1.1 Computer Science

### 💡 What is Computer Science ?
> The field of **computer science (CS)** is the study of **computing**. Computing is the act of transforming information. Computing always starts with a data as *input*. This data is a representation of a state of the world (a number, an electrical signal). Then, the next element is the rule of transition (the logic). Computing is not a random transformation. It is the application of a law or function which determines how the information must change. Computing ends with a data as *output*, either a new information or a different form of the original information with a precise value for the system. Computing is independent of the support. Computing does not limit to mathematical calculation. In computer science, computing implies sorting, searching, inferring.  
> Computing consists of translating a real world problem in a sequence of universal logical instructions. Once the sequence is defined, the tool (computer) can execute it mechanically.
> Computing aim is to model reality and act on it. 

### 📝 A definition of Computer Science
> Computer Science is the discipline whose Object is the study of computing as a fundamental phenomenon of information transformation. Its Method lies in the design and analysis of rigorous algorithms—grounded in the synthesis of mathematics and engineering—with the overarching Project of engineering logical solutions and applications that structurally impact society.

### 👁️ What is a Computer ?
> All computers are made of physical, real-world material that we refer to as hardware. Hardware—which has four components, including **processor**, **memory**, **network**, and **storage**—is the computer component that enables computations. The processor can be regarded as the computer’s “brain,” as it follows instructions from algorithms and processes data. The memory is a means of addressing information in a computer by storing it in consistent locations, while the network refers to the various technological devices that are connected and share information. The hardware and physical components of a computer that permanently house a computer’s data are called storage.
- The algorithmic principles that determine how results are computed makes up **software**. Almost all computers, from the ENIAC to today’s computers, are considered Turing-complete (or Computationally Universal, as opposed to specialized computing devices such as scientific calculators) because they share the same fundamental model for computing results and every computer has the ability to run any algorithm.
- While both hardware and software are important to the practical operation of computers, computer science’s historical roots in mathematics also emphasize a third perspective. Whereas software focuses on the program details for solving problems with computers, theoretical computer science focuses on the mathematical processes behind software.
- Clearly both humans and computers have their strengths and limitations. An example of a problem that humans can solve but computers struggle with is interpreting subtle emotions or making moral judgments in complex social situations. While computers can process data and recognize patterns, they cannot fully understand the nuances of human emotions or ethics, which often involve context, empathy, and experience. On the flip side, there are tasks that neither computers nor humans can perform, such as accurately predicting chaotic systems like long-term weather patterns. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), computer functions that perform tasks, such as visual perception and decision-making processes that usually are performed by human intelligence, these problems remain beyond our collective reach due to the inherent unpredictability and complexity of certain natural systems.
