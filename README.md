## 🧭 My Data Science Journey — Current Focus

🔹 **Current Iteration:** Linear Algebra  
🔹 **Status:** Active, concept-driven learning  

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
- Prioritize **conceptual clarity over speed**
- Understand **why methods work**, not only how to apply them
- Use tools as **instruments of reasoning**, not substitutes for thinking

---

## 🧠 Skills & Competencies (Current Level)

> The following skills reflect what I can already apply in practice  

### 📐 Mathematics

**Linear Algebra**
- Manipulate vectors and matrices
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Interpret linear systems geometrically
- Work with:
  - Matrix operations
  - Linear combinations
  - Rank and system consistency
- Translate mathematical problems into computational form

---

### 💻 Computation & Tools
- Use **GNU Octave** for:
  - Numerical linear algebra
  - Matrix-based problem solving
  - Mathematical experimentation
- Write clear and reproducible scripts
- Document reasoning step by step, not only final results

---

### 🧠 Conceptual & Methodological Skills
- Decompose abstract problems into structured steps
- Focus on **why a method works**, not only how
- Connect mathematical formalism to interpretation
- Learn independently using rigorous academic resources

---

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- Linear algebra problem-solving using GNU Octave
- Well-documented notebooks explaining:
  - the problem structure  
  - the mathematical reasoning  
  - the computational translation  

> These projects are intentionally limited in scope,  
> but rigorous in reasoning and explanation.
