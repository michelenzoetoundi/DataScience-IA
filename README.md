## 🧭 My Data Science Journey — Current Focus

🔹 **Current Iteration:** Linear Algebra  
🔹 **Status:** Active, concept-driven learning  

> My objective is not to use models as black boxes,  
> but to understand the mathematical structures that give them meaning, limits, and power.

My learning path is **iterative rather than linear**.  
Instead of completing all mathematical and technical domains at once, I focus on **one foundational pillar per iteration**, deepening my understanding and returning to other areas when they become necessary.

At this stage, this iteration is **fully dedicated to linear algebra**, which forms the structural backbone of data analysis, machine learning, and optimization.
