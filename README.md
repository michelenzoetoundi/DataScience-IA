## 🏗️ Repository Architecture

The tree structure follows a modular progression, where each domain is segmented into three activity units:
1. **01_Theory**: Conceptual synthesis of chapters studied.
2. **02_Exercises**: Resolution of problems specific to chapters.
3. **03_Practice Files**: Implementation of solutions.

### 🧩 01_Foundations
Core pillars of the system:
* **01_Principles of Data Science**
* **02_CS_Fundamentals**
* **03_Python_Fundamentals**
* **04_Statistics & Excel**

### 🛠️ 02_Data Science Tools
Technological arsenal for data interaction:
* **01_Python**
* **02_R**
* **03_SQL**

### 📐 Mathematics & Advanced Modeling
Mathematical framework and predictive engines:
* **03_Linear Algebra**
* **04_Machine Learning**
* **05_Calculus**
