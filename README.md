## 🧠 Methodology
- Prioritize **conceptual clarity over speed**
- Understand **why methods work**, not only how to apply them
- Use tools as **instruments of reasoning**, not substitutes for thinking

### 💻 Computation & Tools
- Use **GNU Octave** for:
  - Numerical linear algebra
  - Matrix-based problem solving
  - Mathematical experimentation
- Write clear and reproducible scripts
- Document reasoning step by step, not only final results

### 🧠 Conceptual & Methodological Skills
- Decompose abstract problems into structured steps
- Focus on **why a method works**, not only how
- Connect mathematical formalism to interpretation
- Learn independently using rigorous academic resources
