## 🧭 My Data Science Journey — Current Focus

🔹 **Phase:** Mathematical Foundations  
🔹 **Status:** Active, concept-driven learning  

> My objective is not to use models as black boxes,  
> but to understand the mathematical structures that give them meaning, limits, and power.

I am deliberately investing time in foundational mathematics to build a **solid, transferable understanding** of data science concepts before moving to advanced models and large-scale applications.
