## 🧠 Skills & Competencies (Current Level)

> The following skills reflect what I can already apply in practice  

### 📐 Mathematics

**Linear Algebra**
- Manipulate vectors and matrices
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Interpret linear systems geometrically
- Work with:
  - Matrix operations
  - Linear combinations
  - Rank and system consistency
- Translate mathematical problems into computational form

### 💻 Computation & Tools
- Use **GNU Octave** for:
  - Numerical linear algebra
  - Matrix-based problem solving
  - Mathematical experimentation
- Write clear and reproducible scripts
- Document reasoning step by step, not only final results

---

### 🧠 Conceptual & Methodological Skills
- Decompose abstract problems into structured steps
- Focus on **why a method works**, not only how
- Connect mathematical formalism to interpretation
- Learn independently using rigorous academic resources
